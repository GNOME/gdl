* In GdlDockPaned (drag_request): decide which child to pass the request to in function of the coordinate

* Keyboard navigation in floating items: if the parent window has the focus, the keyboard works (sawfish, follow-focus mode) and the item is still in the "tab ring" (don't know the exact name).

* Floating window size negotiation.  See GnomeDockItem's implementation (preferred_width/height arguments).  Also, if the item is resizable, provide some mechanism for doing that without the aid of the window manager.

* When docking with paned, split the paned according to previous relative sizes or something like that.

* Dock to floating items (is this really useful/intuitive?)

* Make the handle_size of the item an argument

* Item behavoirs:  implement the ones missing and maybe think more of them (e.g. positions where it's possible to dock the item, etc.)

* Item properties: Make sure the current works as expected and add some more which are missing (e.g. hideable)

* Make a nicer dragbar for the items, with buttons for undocking, closing, hidding, etc. (See sodipodi, kdevelop)

* Virtualize reorder (?): don't know if this would be useful.

* Virtualize dock_to: don't know either.  Would allow implementing different docking behavior.  Contrast with next item...

* Make a dock_to counterpart: dock_from or something like that.  The basic idea is that if an item doesn't know how to solve a docking request, it transfers the task to the target.  This way, both functions are complementary from a semantic point of view.  This also allows for easier extensibility, as new docking ways are implemented in the "host" dockitem.

* Click to hide in paned handle: basically what mozilla and nautilus do.  Should only be enabled if the "hideable" property (see above) is enabled.

* GdlDockBand: implement a dockitem which can hold items the same way as GnomeDockBand does.

* Think of some other signals the items and the dock could emit which would be useful.
