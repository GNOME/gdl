Gnome Devtool Libraries
=======================

This package contains components and libraries that are intended to be
shared between GNOME development tools, including gnome-debug,
gnome-build, and anjuta2.

The current pieces of GDL include:

 - A symbol browser bonobo component (symbol-browser-control).

 - A docking widget (gdl).

 - A utility library that also contains the stubs and skels for
   the symbol browser and text editor components (gdl, idl).

Discussion of GDL development takes place on the gnome-devtools@gnome.org
mailing list and on #devel-apps at irc.gnome.org.

GDL is licensed under the terms of the GPL.
