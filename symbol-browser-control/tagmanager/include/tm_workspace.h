/*! \file
 The TMWorkspace structure is meant to be used as a singleton to store application
 wide tag information. The workspace is intended to contain a list of global tags
 and a set of work objects (projects or individual files). You need not use the
 workspace, though, to use tag manager, unless you need things like global tags
 and a place to store all current open projects and individual files. TMWorkspace
 is derived from TMWorkObject.
 
 The following example demonstrates the use of workspace functions to create global tags.
 \include tm_global_tags.c

 should be used for autocompletion, calltips, etc.
