Gnome Devtool Libraries
=======================

This package contains components and libraries that are intended to be
shared between GNOME development tools, such as gIDE and gnome-debug.

The current pieces of GDL include:

 - A code-editing bonboo component based on the Scintilla
   widget (scintilla-control).

 - An implementation of the CORBA event service (event-service).

 - A utility library that also contains the stubs and skels for
   the above components (gdl).

Discussion of GDL development takes place on the
gnome-devtools@helixcode.com mailing list.
